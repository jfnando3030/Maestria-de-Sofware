Abstract: The capability of blockchain (BC) technology to record transactions as a distributed digital ledger has facilitated registration, confirmation, and sharing of contracts among legitimate parties in a secure manner. This facility enhances privacy and security in various domains including finance, asset management, Internet of things, and healthcare. Integrated and complete e-governance solutions can be offered by BC platforms. Despite growing usage of BCs for various applications, little is known about its usage in education domain. This chapter aims at critically analyzing the existing techniques used in BCs and their suitability in education domain. The advantages and challenges in using BC-based applications in education are also discussed in this chapter. Security breaches and attacks on using BCs are discussed along with possible countermeasures. A plan of how existing models can be improved to enhance performance of BCs in applications belonging to education is also discussed.
