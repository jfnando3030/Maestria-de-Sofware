Abstract: Multifactor authentication is one of the de facto standards for systems requiring strong security. In most cases, multifactor authentication is complex and not user-friendly because it requires additional steps as far as end users are concerned. With two-factor authentication, in addition to entering a username and a password (first factor), users need to enter an additional code (second factor) manually that they receive by short message service or look up in a previously printed list of passwords, or that is generated by a hardware or software token. So, although introducing additional authentication factors greatly increases the level of security, it could also become frustrating for end users. This chapter reviews a wide variety of modern and classic multifactor authentication systems and methods.
