ABSTRACT = {Latency is a critical issue that impacts the performance of decentralized systems. Recently we designed various protocols to regulate the injection rate of unverified transactions into the system to improve system performance. Each of the protocols is designed to address issues related to some particular network traffic syndrome. In this work, we first provide the review of our prior protocols. We then provide a hybrid scheme that combines our transaction injection protocols and provides an optimal linear combination of the protocols based on the syndromes in the network. The goal is to speed up the verification process of systems that rely on only one single basic protocol. The underlying basic protocols are Periodic Injection of Transaction via Evaluation Corridor (PITEC), Probabilistic Injection of Transactions (PIT), and Adaptive Semi-synchronous Transaction Injection (ASTI).},
